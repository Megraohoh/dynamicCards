# NSS Exercise: Dynamic Cards

### Description:
> A page with a textbox that accepts input and is used for cards as the 'create' button is selected.

* Create an HTML page that contains a text area and a button labeled Create.
* When the user enters in text into the text area and then clicks the create button, create a new card element in the DOM. 
* When the user clicks the Delete button, the containing card, and no other cards, should then be removed from the DOM. 
* Not just made invisible, actually removed from the DOM.

### Final Result:
> All requirements are met.
